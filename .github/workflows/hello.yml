# ## 🔧 What is this file?

# This is a **GitHub Actions workflow file**.
# It tells GitHub to **run automatic tasks** whenever something happens in your repo.

# Think of it like a **robot helper** 🤖 that runs commands for you.

# This file usually lives here:

# ```
# .github/workflows/main.yml
# ```

# ---

# ## 🚀 When does it run?

# ```yaml
# on: [push]
# ```

# 👉 This means **every time you push code to GitHub**, this workflow runs automatically.

# ---

# ## 🧠 What is a "job"?

# ```yaml
# jobs:
#   Explore-GitHub-Actions:
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
# ```

# A **job** is a set of steps that run on a virtual computer.

# * `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
#   → GitHub gives you a **temporary Linux machine** to run your commands.

# You don’t set it up. GitHub does everything.

# ---

# ## 🪜 What are "steps"?

# Steps are just **commands that run one after another**.

# ### 🖨 Step 1 – Print why it started

# ```yaml
# - run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
# ```

# It prints:

# > The job started because of a **push** event.

# ---

# ### 💻 Step 2 – Tell which machine is running

# ```yaml
# - run: echo "🐧 This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
# ```

# It tells you the operating system (Ubuntu/Linux).

# ---

# ### 🌿 Step 3 – Show branch & repo name

# ```yaml
# - run: echo "🔎 The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
# ```

# This prints:

# * Your branch name (like `main`)
# * Your repository name

# ---

# ### 📥 Step 4 – Download your code

# ```yaml
# - name: Check out repository code
#   uses: actions/checkout@v4
# ```

# This is **VERY IMPORTANT**.

# It downloads your GitHub repo code into the virtual machine so the workflow can use it.

# Without this, the runner can't see your project files.

# ---

# ### 📂 Step 5 – Confirm repo was downloaded

# ```yaml
# - run: echo "💡 The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
# ```

# Just a message saying your code is now available.

# ---

# ### 🧪 Step 6 – Ready to test

# ```yaml
# - run: echo "🖥️ The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
# ```

# Another message — usually this is where real testing/build commands would go.

# ---

# ### 📃 Step 7 – List all project files

# ```yaml
# - name: List files in the repository
#   run: |
#     ls ${{ github.workspace }}
# ```

# This shows **all files and folders** inside your repo.

# Good for checking if everything is there.

# ---

# ### ✅ Step 8 – Show job result

# ```yaml
# - run: echo "🍏 This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
# ```

# At the end, it prints if the job **passed or failed**.

# ---

# ## 🎯 So what is the REAL use?

# Right now → **It’s just a demo** that prints information.

# But in real projects, GitHub Actions is used to:

# ✅ Automatically run tests
# ✅ Build your project
# ✅ Check code errors
# ✅ Deploy website to server
# ✅ Deploy backend to cloud
# ✅ Run linters/formatters

# So instead of only printing messages, you would replace steps with things like:

# ```yaml
# - run: npm install
# - run: npm test
# - run: npm run build
# ```

# ---

# ## 🧩 In one line:

# 👉 This file makes GitHub **automatically run commands on your project whenever you push code**.
